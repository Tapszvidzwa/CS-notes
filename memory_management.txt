Types of memory errors
==========================

1] Use After Free(dangling pointer error)
 --------------------------------------- 
 You continue to use memory after youve freed it
 Result: some other part of the program will see values change mysteriously

2] Memory leak
----------------
 We forgot to free something that we allocated
 Result: we fill up memory with stuff that we are not using

3] Double/Invalid Free
-----------------------
 We free memory twice
 Result: different parts of the program may accidentally share the same memory

4] Buffer overflow
---------------------
 Our program accesses memory beyond the bounds of the object we allocated
 Result: we may read garbage values, or we could overwrite the contents of other allocated memory

5] Uninitialized read
----------------------
  We dereference pointers that point to unitialized memory
 Result: we'll see unpredictable values
 

* Valgrind can help you search through the errors since it stops exactly where the last error occured.
